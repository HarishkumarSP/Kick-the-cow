            <p><h1>Game Instructions</h1>
            <h2 class="instructions">After clicking the start the game will start we first need to touch the Vegetable shop
                then only game starts and the cow start towards the shop after that
                we have to click the cow it will disappear and at the same time score will increases
                and if the cow reaches the shop the game will over and we have to retry by kick again menu.<br>
                
                1.First level- In this  level if we get more than 40 means it goes to level 2 as well as cows only there 
                  and it is a first level because of that its very easy so that the time complexity of the level is too slow
                  it means we have a so much time to click.<br>
                
                2.Second level-In this level along with cows there is humans are there if we touches the human  the score will get reduced
                  and the moving speed of cows will be fast and the time complexity is high
                  so as much as fast we have to click the cows.<br>
                
                3.Third level-In this level additionaly there is a thief is there along with them
                  if we clicks the theif the game will over and the score is also reduced the time complexity is very high 
                  and hard to win in this level because we only click the cow not rest of them.<br>
