# Kick-the-cow
My first front end game project,the game is all about kicking the cow to not get close to the vegetable shop.
Instructions
*After we getting into a game we first need to touch the Vegetable shop  then only the cow start towards the shop then we have to click the cow it will disappear at the sime time score will increases and if the cow reaches the shop the game will over and we have to retry by kick again menu.*
In this game i have set a three levels

1.First level- In this level if we get more than 40 means it goes to level 2 as well as cows only there and it is a first level because of that its very easy so that the time complexity of the level is too slow it means we have a so much time to click.

2.Second level-In this level along with cows there is humans are there if we touches the human  the score will get reduced and the moving speed of cows will be fast and the time complexity is high so as much as fast we have to click the cows.

3.Third level-In this level additionaly there is a thief is there along with them if we clicks the theif the game got over and the time complexity is very very high and very hard to win in this level because we only click the cow not rest of them.

*Concepts used:
 HTML-concepts like adding images ,making many basic concepts( ids, classes, type),and moving the levels to the next page using the(href) to getting to the another pages.
CSS-concepts like positioning, aligning for displaying and hover for showing transitions and changing background colors and for sizing the images placing in a correct places.
JS-Basic Java Script like DOM for accessing those id, class and uses
Functions, interval time using setInterval and if statements for scores and levels.
